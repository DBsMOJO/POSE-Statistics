# POSE-Statistics


## Task 

The user should be prompted to enter multiple positive integers using the
keyboard, separated by the Enter key. By entering the number 0, the user ends
the entry.
The prompt is in the form: “Number 9: “, where instead of 9, of course, it
represents the current number of the number (starting at 1).
The program outputs the sum and mean of the numbers entered and the largest number.
Any special cases that arise (see test specifications) must be handled correctly!
